\section{Introduction}

With the increasing adoption of cloud architecture in modern software system, it has reshaped the way systems are designed, deployed and operated.
The technology behind this is containerization, which enables applications
to be packaged with their dependencies and executed consistently across environments.

To orchestrate containerized workload at scale, Kubernetes has emerged as the standard platform, by providing powerful automation capabilities for deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. That said, the same feature that make Kubernetes flexible and extensive also introduce security challenges. The systems distribute architecture, extensive API framework and declarative configurations make the system prone to misconfiguration, unauthorized privilege gains and unauthorized access.

The security in Kubernetes relies heavily on correct configuration by administrators and developers and is not enabled by default. There have been real-world incidents that have demonstrated that insecure details, lax role-based access control(RABC) policies and unprotected control plane can allow attackers to compromise entire clusters. With this once the attackers gain access to the Kubernetes API or a privileged workload, they can deploy malicious containers, expand access through connected systems, or abuse cluster resources. 

Recent researches highlight the common occurrence of these security threats and the limitation of existing defense mechanism. \cite{Moric2025KubernetesSecurity} demonstrates that many Kubernetes compromise stems from the control plane misconfiguration and inadequate security hardening, reinforcing the need for organized security baseline and compliance centered configurations. \cite{Chen2025ShadowKube} shows that the traditional monitoring technique and rule-based defenses are often ineffective in Kubernetes environments, where they suggest the use of behavioral monitoring and honeypot to detect and stop attacks. \cite{Cesarano2025KubeFence} points out that the role-based access control in the Kubernetes API is to broad to protect, and recommends the use of API filtering to reduce the attacks. These studies show that there is not a single security system that will protect Kubernetes, but a combination of preventive hardening, reducing attacks surfaces and active defenses during runtime.

By building on these insight, this paper provides a systematic analysis of security hardening techniques and security strategies for containerized environments and Kubernetes based deployments.

This paper aims to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Examine the key security vulnerabilities and potential attack surface for Kubernetes.
    \item Review and analyze recent approaches designed to address these issues.
    \item Compare these approaches, highlighting their strength, weaknesses, and aspects of deploying them.
    \item Present challenges and outline potential direction for future research to strengthen Kubernetes clusters.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background and Threat Model}

This section presents the technical background on containerized systems and Kubernetes, and defines threat model used throughout the paper.

\subsection{Virtualization and containerization}

Virtualization has long been used to improve resource utilization by runnung multiple virtual machines (VM) to run on a single host. The virtual machines each included their own guest operating system, which provided strong isolation between individual workloads, but at the cost of higher resource usage consumption and slower startup times. While it did improve the infrastructure flexibility, it does not support the scalability and rapid deployment that is required by modern cloud architecture.

Containerization addressed these limitations by enabling application to execute within isolated user spaces while sharing the host operating system kernel. Container engines such as Docker use Linux built isolation and resource limiting mechanism so that containers behave like in separate environment with the same operating system kernel. Compared to the virtual machines, they are faster, more lightweight, consume less resources. However, sharing the host kernel model also introduces new security risk, such as misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to allow them to escape the container isolation and access the host resources. \cite{Moric2025KubernetesSecurity}

\subsection{Container orchestration and Kubernetes}

As the container application becomes more widely adopted, the need to manage a large number of containers across distributed environements led to the development of a platform to manage these containers. Kubernetes emerged as the dominant orchestration system, automating deployment, management, recovery and scaling of containerized application.

Kubernetes operates using clusters that consist of a control plane and a set of worker nodes. The control plane consist of components such as API server, scheduler, control manager and the etcd key-value store that are critical to the management of the overall state of the clusters. Worker nodes run applications workloads in the form of pods, these pods group one or more containers together and share network and storage resources. Interactions with the clusters such as deploying application or changing the configuration file is done through the Kubernetes API.

Even though Kubernetes makes application management easier and more efficient through flexibility and automation, it also expands the systems attack surface. It exposes a wide variety of functionality that, if not properly secured, can be exploited by attackers. Studies \cite{Cesarano2025KubeFence} show that many vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are caused by API features, making the Kubernetes API a target for attackers. Furthermore, because Kubernetes workloads are constantly changing, making consistent policies is difficult, as shown in real-world deployment \cite{Chen2025ShadowKube}.

\subsection{Security Model of Kubernetes}

Kubernetes several built--in security mechanism specifically for the API, such as authentication, authorization and admission control. Authentication confirms the identify of the user and services interacting with the cluster, while authorization is generally handled by role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC decides permission for Kubernetes resources such as pods, deployment, and specifies which actions the users and services can perform.

However, RBAC only gives basic control of who can access resources, but does not limit how specific settings inside those resources can be used. This makes it possible for users with legitimate access to the resources to abuse advanced configurations to gain more privileges or exploit weaknesses. Security measures, such as network policies, pod security settings, and audit logging need to be manually set up and maintained by administrators. With these controls often applied inconsistently or turned off, it contributes significantly to Kubernetes security incidents \cite{Moric2025KubernetesSecurity}.


\section{Security Challenges in Kubernetes}

Despite it's wide adoption and powerful capabilities, Kubernetes introduces a number of security challenges which is a result of it's architectural design, configuration complexity and operational model.

\subsection{Configuration Complexity and Misconfiguration}

One of the biggest security challenges with Kubernetes is the complexity of it's configuration models. Kubernetes depends on declarative configuration files, which are files where you tell the system what you want it to look like, rather than what to do. While this enables automation and scalability, it also makes mistakes more likely. To prevent security issues, administrators have to correctly configure parameters authentication, networking, storage and workload isolation.

In real-deployments, misconfigurations such as giving to many permisive RBAC roles, unsecured API endpoints, privileged containers, or setting up service accounts incorrectly are common. These misconfigurations can give users or workloads more access, allowing attackers to take control. Studies have demonstrated that many Kubernetes security challenges are not caused by unknown vulnerabilities, but by insecure default settings and configurations \cite{Moric2025KubernetesSecurity}.

\subsection{Control plane Exposure and API Abuse}

For attackers the Kubernetes control plane is a high-value target due to it's central role in managing clusters and workload scheduling. Since all clusters are managed through the Kubernetes API, it exposes extensive functionality for creating, modifying and deleting resources.
