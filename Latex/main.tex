Normal Latex citation and bibliography should be used \cite{BasinCKPSS18}.

\section{Related work}


\section{Analysis}


\section{Conclusion}

\section{Other sections and subsections}
Add new sections (or subsections) as needed. You can describe challenges and open problems, solutions and future directions, etc. You can present some solutions to the security problems described in previous sections. You can find such solutions from recent literature that you have studied. You can also describe your proposed solutions if you have any. You may present future directions if you have identified any. 

\subsection{About references} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item You should have at least 3 scholar and peer-reviewed articles from well-reputed conferences and journals from last 3 years. 
	\item Use a standard reference style as you can see in the references section. Simply download Bibtex info from \url{dblp.org} and add them to the Ref.bib file in the attachment so that your references are automatically added. You might alternatively take it from Google Scholar, but it is not as precise as DBLP: In Google Scholar: Go to ``Bibliography manager'' at \url{https://scholar.google.com/scholar_settings?} and select ``Show links to import citations into Bibtex'' and Save.

\end{itemize}
